# WBSCTE Diploma Results API

This is a **simple API** to fetch results for **WBSCTE Diploma Students** from the official website. It scrapes the data and presents it in a structured JSON format.

> **Disclaimer:** This is just a **time-pass project**, built for fun and learning. I have **no idea if this is legal or not**, so **please don’t sue me**! 🥺🤕

#### What does it do?
- Accepts registration number via POST request.
Fetches student results from the WBSCTE official result portal.
- Returns a clean JSON with student details, - subject-wise grades, and GPA.

#### Who is this for?
- Strictly for WBSCTE Diploma Students.
- If you’re not a WBSCTE student — you’re just here for the code, aren't you? 😉

#### Usecases
- 🤔 I don't know. Who thinks about usecases for a time-pass project? 😂
